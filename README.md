## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Especially to plan carefully the structure before starting to code. This has helped me much in dealing with unexpected CSS behavious later on.

I have also started playing with some transform and shadow properties on CSS, as well as Grid. For some reason, using grid-column or grid-row was not working properly, so I had to specify the start and endings. Nor sure why, but it did the work.
